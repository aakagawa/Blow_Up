# Blow Up v3.0.2
Blow Up v3.0.2 is an advanced real-time video processing application developed with openFrameworks v0.12.0, that transforms camera input based on the presence and activity of people in its field of view. Originally conceived by Conroy Badger in 2007, the v3.0.2 was developed to adapt to newer platforms.

## Features 
* **Real-time Camera Input:** Captures video input from the device's camera. 
* **Dynamic People Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv4 object detection model to instantly identify people entering the camera's field of view.
* **Video Processing:** Applies dynamic processing depending on the presence and positions of people within the view. 
* **High Resolution Rendering:** Displays the processed video in real-time. 

## Build/Installation
### MacOS
1. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Ensure openFrameworks v0.12.0 is installed.
   - Clone or download the [ofxTensorFlow2 repository](https://github.com/zkmkarlsruhe/ofxTensorFlow2) to your openFrameworks addons folder. (Replace OF_ROOT with the path to your openFrameworks installation).
```
cd OF_ROOT/addons
git clone https://github.com/zkmkarlsruhe/ofxTensorFlow2.git
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - TensorFlow 2 and cppflow 2 are required.
    - Pull cppflow to libs/cppflow. 

```
cd ofxTensorFlow2
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Download the pre-built [TensorFlow2 C library](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) and extract:  
        `include/` to `/usr/local/include`\
        `lib/` to `/usr/local/lib/` 

3. **Configure YOLOv4:**
    - Copy YOLOv4 example data to your project folder. (Replace PROJECT with the path to your openFrameworks project folder).
```
cd ofxTensorFlow2
cp -r example_yolo_v4/bin/data/* PROJECT_ROOT/bin/data/
```

4. **Project Setup:**
    - Use openFrameworks projectGenerator to add `ofxGui`, `ofxXmlSettings`, `ofxTensorFlow2` to your project and update.

5. **Build and Run:**
```
make Release
make RunRelease
```

## App GUI Instructions

- **Press key "g" to show/hide GUI.**

- **Horizontal Offset Factor:** Maximum random horizontal offset after blow up as a fraction of image width (0.0-1.0).
- **Vertical Offset Factor:** Maximum random vertical offset after blow up as a fraction of image height (0.0-1.0).
- **Transition Duration:** Duration of transitions from normal to blow up (500-10000 ms).
- **Focus Follow Speed:** Speed at which the focus follows the detected person (0.01-0.5).

### Detection Settings
- **Detection Area Top Left X:** X-coordinate for the top left corner of the detection area (0 to input width).
- **Detection Area Top Left Y:** Y-coordinate for the top left corner of the detection area (0 to input height).
- **Detection Area Bottom Right X:** X-coordinate for the bottom right corner of the detection area; defaults to maximum width (0 to input width).
- **Detection Area Bottom Right Y:** Y-coordinate for the bottom right corner of the detection area; defaults to maximum height (0 to input height).
- **Required Confidence:** Minimum confidence level required to detect a person (0.0-0.9).
- **Required Size:** Minimum size required for a person to be considered detected as a fraction of the total detection area (0.0-0.9).
- **Transition In Timeout:** Timeout before transition after detection, in milliseconds (0-10000 ms).
- **Transition Out Timeout:** Timeout before transition after undetection, in milliseconds (0-10000 ms).
